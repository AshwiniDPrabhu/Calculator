## Calculator App

### Development
There are two different services, the backend is built using nodeJS. This can be run by
```
npm run server
```

The client is a ReactJS application generated by create-react-app. To run the client application
```
npm run client
```

Now the react application can be used from http://localhost:3001

Note: `npm install` has to be run inside client folder as well as the folder containing server `index.js` file. 

To run both server and client application
````
npm run dev
````

### Production

Run the build command to generate the static files to serve
```
npm run build --prefix client
```

Note: Here the socket port should be the same as the port number server is hosted

Run the node server using the command
```
PORT=80 node index.js
```
